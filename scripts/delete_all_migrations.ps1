<#
PowerShell script to delete or back up all files under the migrations/ folder.

Usage examples (run from repo root):
  # Dry-run (shows what would be done)
  .\scripts\delete_all_migrations.ps1 -WhatIf

  # Backup migrations to migrations/deleted_backup_TIMESTAMP and remove originals from git (tracked files are moved and committed)
  .\scripts\delete_all_migrations.ps1 -Backup

  # Permanently delete all migrations (git rm for tracked files, Remove-Item for untracked)
  .\scripts\delete_all_migrations.ps1 -Force

  # Permanently delete including any existing backups under migrations/backup or migrations/deleted_backup (use with care)
  .\scripts\delete_all_migrations.ps1 -Force -DeleteBackup

Notes:
- This script will act on everything under ./migrations except it will skip the script itself if it's placed in migrations (we put it in scripts/).
- For files tracked by git, the script uses `git rm` so the deletion is recorded in history and will be pushed when you push changes.
- The script prompts for confirmation by default. Use -Force to skip prompt.
- Requires git available in PATH.
